# An Explorative Study on Greenhouse Gas Emissions & Polar Ice Cap Melting
The research aims to find relations between polar ice areas and GHG emissions with the following research objectives(RO):
- Level 1 Research Objectives: Descriptive Statistical Analysis
    *  Descriptive analysis(Mean, Standard Deviation, lower-quartile, upper-quartile etc.)
  
- Level 2 Research Objectives: Inferential Statistical Analysis
    * T-test
  
- Level 3 Research Objectives: Machine Learning
    * Multi-linear regression
    * Support vector regressor
    * Random forest algorithm
    * Adaptive boosting algorithm
    * MLP algorithm

- Level 4 Research Objectives: Deep Learning
    * LSTM and GRU
    * 1D CNN
 


This is an academic project as part of DAV course at Leeds Beckett University.
